Isn’t it ironic? When they’re in flesh n bones you have no time for them; barely even notice their presence. But the moment they’re lost, they become the center of your universe.

Why do we need people dead to love them? Why not value them when they’re alive? How does it even matters if you make it rain gold when they’re no more. How would your mournings, statuses, and messages reach till them once they leave? Are we technically so sound yet? Other days we hardly remember we have someone like that in our lives, and one fine day when the news strikes, all our love and affection for that person comes sloshing out! But does it really matters then?

Why not just start loving people when we have them? Because I think it’s useless to show concern later if you can’t be there when the person needs you the most. Earlier I wondered, and now I guess I know why this happens. We look back on all the harrowing when we have the person alive. Whereas, we look back on the positives of that person when we lose them forever.

It’s difficult for us, young people to understand how brief life is and how quickly it passes.

Time is running out for all of us. Time is too short for indecision and vacillation. Do not halt between two opinions. Only fools say the time is long. Each day the bank named Time opens a new account for every one of us, and we have 86,400 seconds each day to consume and to invest. It neither allows balances nor overdrafts.
